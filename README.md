# Vowel_play
Vowels are the nucleus of every sylable. If we can identify vowels we can go a long way towards being able to identify speach audio. I have a degree in linguistics from the University of Arizona. A large part of linguistics is phonetics, the study of how humans produce and perceive sounds. A method of this study of sounds is looking at spectograms. With some studying one can look at a spectogram and see what sounds are being made. Vowels are very distinct when looking at a spectogram. The dark lines that stretch across the spectogram are voiced segments. What that means is that your glottis is engaged when producing the sound. All vowels are voiced so that is one of the ways we are able to identify vowels. Looking at the spectogram we see multiple voice segments stacked on top of each other, the technical term for these voice segments are formants. Theere are two formants that tell us which vowel that is being produced.
